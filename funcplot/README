REQUIREMENTS

Tandy Color Computer with at least 32 KB of RAM and the Disk Basic
environment.


HELP SCREEN

Edit a mathematical function of x at the Function prompt.
For example: 2*x+x^3-sin(x)/4.

Supported functions: sin, cos, tan, atn, log, exp, sqr, int, fix.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor.  Note that the
left arrow key does not erase the character that precedes the cursor.
To do that, use the Clear key. To erase the character at the cursor,
use Shift-Clear.

Press the Break key to see the main menu, which allows you to quit
this program.


BASIC LOADER

The FUNCPLOT.BAS file contains this Basic loader program, which
ensures that the first PMODE 4 graphics screen is available at
$0E00 and that the binary file is loaded at normal speed:

10 GOTO 70
20 POKE 65496,0
30 LOADM "FUNCPLOT"
40 EXEC
50 POKE 65496,0
60 END
70 PCLEAR 4:GOTO 20

The FUNCPLOT.BIN loads at $2800. It uses the high-speed poke if
running on a CoCo 3.


COMPILING THE SOURCES

Install the CMOC C-like compiler for the 6809 and give this command:

    cmoc verbiste.c
