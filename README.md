# CoCoFun
Random CoCo 3 code written with CMOC. This repository is intended to be a fun way to write quick and dirty little programs for the CoCo 3.

To compile this code you will need to install the following on your Mac OS X system.

There are several folders which are described below.
* Breakout - Breakout game written in C and assembly language
* Demo - A cheesy little demo program to test CMOC
* Scratch - Scratch pad for testing ideas quickly
* Misc - Folder containing scripts to help import graphic data
* Ancient - Very old (from the 80s) assembly language programs
* cfgs - Configuration directories for testing programs with mess
